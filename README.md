# The-Burner-Phone-Handbook
Hate industrialized society? Hate how your privacy is constantly invaded by the NSA? You have found your solution in this guide to creating a safe and secure environment for all your day-to-day phone needs.

### Introduction
The government is constantly capturing data on your PC(s), laptop(s), and mobile device(s). This is no secret, and there is virtually no way to stop it, as all devices since the 2000s have been backdoored. Although the NSA doesn't randomly check on arbitrary people, it does feel like an invasion of privacy. Either way, this guide will help you with your privacy. Do note, this guide will **only** focus on mobile devices.

### Acquiring the Phone
It is important to figure out what you want a burner phone for, as the use will change what you need to do. If you simply want a standard phone for unencrypted calls and texts, then choose a flip phone. If you want to use a phone for encrypted messages, apps, the internet, or navigation, choose an Android smartphone. Prepaid smartphones and flip phones are generally the same price, the cheapest flip phones being 20~ USD, and smartphones being 25-40~ USD. These prices were off the Walmart website, but you should only buy them in person with cash. The phone won't be flashy, it won't be super popular, or new whatsoever. The point of a burner phone is to use it for a short amount of time and then get rid of it.

When in person, cover up as much as possible, or as much as you feel comfortable with. Make sure there are no exposed tattoos, birthmarks, or other identifying features. If you have to, use makeup to cover the spot(s); don't have fragile masculinity. Make sure that while going out to purchase this phone, you leave your own personal phone elsewhere. Once you select your phone and the service plan, we can get started. Please note that the service plan should come from the actual company that makes the phone.

### Activating The Phone
You must be in a place with WIFI, such as a coffee shop, fast food restaurant, or even in the same Walmart parking lot if possible. If you don't want the phone associated with you whatsoever, make sure to activate it away from your home or any place you frequent. Moreover, do not activate the phone near your personal phone when you activate it.

If you are planning on using the phone elsewhere, such as a different state or distant city/town, it is even safer to activate it there. In the case you are intending to do so, and activate it in your home state (for example: Idaho), then travel to the location you want to use it in, it will know that you started in your home state, in this example, Idaho. If you activate it in a different city/state, then your starting location will be unknown.

Just follow through with the instructions on your burner phone to activate it, and if it requires an email, just use a website like temp-mail.com or Guerrillamail.com.

### Smartphone Setup
If you are using a flip phone, you are done, as this is all you can really do security-wise. If you want to learn how to use your burner phone more discreetly and securely, I recommend you read up on "Burner Phone Best Practices: A User's Guide" from CrimethInc (https://crimethinc.com/2017/03/27/burner-phone-best-practices).

Now, for the smartphone users, follow along:

1. Charge your phone and power it on
2. Start your phone
3. When and if you are asked to create a Google account, do not. Somewhere on your screen, you should see a "Skip" button; press it.
4. Deny all permissions or optional data collection. You have to accept the terms of service, but we obviously won't be agreeing to follow them.
5. The default screen lock is probably not the best choice, so change it to a password and choose something alphanumeric. Do not under any circumstances use facial ID or fingerprint ID.
6. Once you have set your phone up, navigate to the homescreen/app library and delete/disable **EVERYTHING** that you do not need. This includes (but is not limited to) Google Drive, Gmail, YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, and any mobile games. Some apps, unfortunately, cannot be disabled or uninstalled due to the manufacturer's settings, so just avoid using them at all costs.

### Apps You Will Need
After you remove all the apps you do not need, you can get the ones you will need. The general rule of thumb is to install the absolute minimum. I will list the apps you will need (however, do note that ViMusic and NewPipe are not required) and their uses.

**{App Name}** _[Purpose]_ (Instead of)
**{F-Droid}** _[Find and download apps]_ (Google Play Store, APK Pure)
**{Signal}** _[Encrypted Messaging]_ (SMS, TextNow, TextFree, WhatsApp, Messenger)
**{Orbot}** _[A proxy that routes all your device's internet traffic through Tor]_ (N/A)
**{Riseup or Mullvad}** _[Makes your phone's internet traffic appear to come from a different geographical location]_ (NordVPN, and Orbot if desired)
**{DuckDuckGo Browser}** _[Standard everyday browsing with minimal tracking]_ (Chrome Browser, Firefox, Opera)
**{Tor Browser}** _[Access the internet more securely and anonymously]_ (Chrome Browser, Firefox, Opera)
**{Simple Keyboard}** _[A keyboard that does not monitor your words or keystrokes]_ (Gboard, standard pre-installed keyboard)
**{Organic Maps}** _[Maps and navigation]_ (Google maps, Waze, Open Street Maps)
**{NewPipe}** _[Watch YouTube videos without an account or tracking]_ (YouTube)
**{ViMusic}** _[Listen to music without ads, an account, or tracking]_ (Spotify, Pandora, other free radio apps)

### F-Droid
1. Open your browser (this time being your default browser) and go to https://f-droid.org/
2. Press the button that says "Download F-Droid"
3. After the APK has been installed, download the app.
4. If your phone gives you a notification saying its security permissions are blocking app installations from "this source" (your default browser). If this happens, just select "install anyway," or if that option isn't there, go to your settings and allow app installations from "this source" (your default browser).

That's all, you now have F-Droid running, and if it exhibits issues, just uninstall and reinstall it.

### DuckDuckGo, Signal, Riseup, Mullvad, Simple Keyboard, Organic Maps, and NewPipe
This section is quite simple, as all you have to do is open F-Droid, click the green magnifying glass button at the bottom of your screen, search for the app, and download it. For the rest of the tutorial, where you have to look something up, use DuckDuckGo, a VPN, and Simple Keyboard.

### Orbot and Tor Browser
F-Droid no longer includes GuardianProject in its repos by default, so you will have to download the repo manually. To do so, open DuckDuckGo and navigate to https://guardianproject.info/fdroid/, or simply search "GuardianProject F-droid" and open the one that says "Guardian Project Official App Repository." Follow the instructions inside the F-Droid app and GuardianProject in order to install it. When installed, follow the same instructions from the previous section.

### ViMusic
ViMusic can simply be found at https://github.com/vfsfitvnm/ViMusic. Just download the latest "app-release.apk" from the Releases tab and install the app on your phone.

### Additional Apps
Whenever you feel like you want to install additional apps, just go back to F-Droid and find whatever piques your interest. But do keep in mind, the fewer the apps, the safer you are. If you have fewer apps, you will have fewer opportunities for attack or infiltration, and there will be less data available about your usage on that device (however, if used correctly, nothing can be traced back to you).

### Disposal of the Phone
The point of a burner phone is to get rid of it when you no longer need it. Despite what the name might suggest, please do not literally burn your phone, as it may release toxic chemicals and fumes.

1. Delete everything from your phone. You can do this by navigating to Settings > System > Reset > Erase All Data (commonly known as a factory reset, and may be displayed as such)
2. After ensuring the reset has been completed, remove the battery and SIM card from the phone.
3. Destroy the actual phone, which can be done by running it over with a car, hitting it with a hammer, or doing anything that seems fun (but safe).
4. Dispose of the physical phone and SIM card in places where they are extremely unlikely to be found, such as a random city trash can, dumpster, garbage truck, or just bury it in a secluded location. Please do this for both the physical phone and SIM card in **SEPARATE** locations.
5. The Battery can be saved and reused later if you have a use for it. You could even give it to a friend, family member, or someone random if they happen to have a compatible phone. Or, if you want, just keep it as a backup battery. However, if you don't have a use for it, it is better to dispose of it. In the scenario that it is found in your possession, it could narrow down which phone model you used.

Please pay your gratitude towards the people mentioned in this section, and make sure to purchase Michael Bazzell's "Extreme Privacy: What It Takes To Disappear" to support him! The only reason I linked a free download site is because some cannot afford such things, have no stores that carry his books, or simply do not want to purchase the book. I am also doing so because I do not want anyone to rob a store for the book, and I would rather someone peacefully acquire it online without a financial transaction.

### Final Notes
I am not responsible for anything the reader may do with this knowledge, nor am I supporting what the reader may do, but simply guiding the reader on how to stay safe and secure. I do not hold any stance on, or endorsement of, the contents of the videos or media listed in the previous ‘Additional Resources’ section, and I will not disclose my personal opinions on anything. This all might seem wasteful, and chances are, you support preserving and saving the environment. Yes, in some ways it is wasteful, but it is also extremely safe, and the best way to stay anonymous. It’s better to replace your phone periodically and produce some plastic waste than to compromise your privacy and security, particularly if you intend to conduct clandestine activities. Stay safe, stay dangerous, and enjoy your privacy!
